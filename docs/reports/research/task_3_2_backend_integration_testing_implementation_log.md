def sample_queries():
    return [
        ResearchQuery(query='What are the latest AI developments in healthcare?', max_subagents=2, max_iterations=3),
        ResearchQuery(query='How is quantum computing affecting financial modeling?', max_subagents=3, max_iterations=4),
        ResearchQuery(query='Latest breakthroughs in renewable energy storage', max_subagents=2, max_iterations=3)
    ]
```

**Mock Research Result:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_research_result():
    return ResearchResult(
        research_id=uuid4(),
        query="Test query",
        report="Comprehensive research report...",
        citations=[CitationInfo(...)],
        sources_used=[],
        total_tokens_used=1500,
        execution_time=30.0,
        subagent_count=3,
        report_sections=["Introduction", "Methodology", "Findings", "Conclusion"]
    )
```

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. Mock Result Query Mismatch
**Issue:** Static mock result had hardcoded query that didn't match test input
**Solution:** Implemented dynamic mock that generates results based on actual query input

### 2. Async Method Call Issues
**Issue:** Some tests called async methods without await
**Solution:** Updated all async method calls to use proper await syntax

### 3. Data Structure Inconsistencies
**Issue:** Tests expected dictionary access but got Pydantic model objects
**Solution:** Updated assertions to use proper attribute access for Pydantic models

### 4. Execution Time Retrieval
**Issue:** History items showed None for execution_time
**Solution:** Fixed ResearchService to properly extract execution_time from result objects

### 5. Type Hint Compatibility
**Issue:** ResearchService had undefined type hints causing import errors
**Solution:** Updated type hints to use proper Dict[str, Any] annotations
