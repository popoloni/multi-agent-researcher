## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ResearchHistory Component Features

#### Core Functionality
- **History Loading:** Supports both localStorage and API data sources
- **Query Reuse:** One-click selection to populate main research input
- **Search & Filter:** Real-time search with status and sorting filters
- **Bulk Operations:** Multi-select with bulk delete and favorite actions
- **Favorites System:** Star/unstar queries for quick access
- **Tag System:** Automatic tag extraction and display

#### Advanced Features
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States:** Smooth loading indicators and skeleton screens
- **Accessibility:** Full ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **Performance:** Optimized rendering with React.memo and useMemo

#### Data Management
```javascript
// History entry structure
{
  id: string,
  query: string,
  timestamp: ISO string,
  status: 'completed' | 'failed' | 'running',
  sources_count: number,
  duration: number (seconds),
  tokens_used: number,
  subagent_count: number,
  favorite: boolean,
  tags: string[]
}
```

### Integration Architecture

#### State Management Flow
1. **ResearchInterface** manages global research state
2. **ResearchHistory** handles local history state and operations
3. **Data Flow:** Completed research → History storage → Display
4. **Communication:** Parent-child callbacks for query selection

#### Component Communication
```javascript
// Parent to Child
<ResearchHistory 
  ref={historyRef}
  onSelectQuery={handleSelectQueryFromHistory}
  onLoadHistory={loadHistoryFromAPI}
/>

// Child to Parent (via ref)
historyRef.current.addToHistory(researchData);
```
