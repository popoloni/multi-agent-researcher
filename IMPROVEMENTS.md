## Implemented Improvements

### Notification System
- Created NotificationContext implementation with provider, hooks, and notification management functions
- Updated Header component to use NotificationBadge and NotificationContext
- Wrapped App with NotificationProvider to enable notifications across the application
- Enhanced Research page to use notifications for research events

### Asynchronous Research Tasks
- Implemented proper asynchronous handling for research tasks in backend
- Added detailed progress tracking for research tasks
- Implemented research cancellation functionality
- Added error handling and logging for research tasks
- Updated frontend to support research cancellation

### UI Enhancements
- Improved ResearchStatus component to show more detailed progress information
- Added estimated time remaining for research tasks
- Enhanced progress bar visualization
- Added cancellation confirmation and feedback

## Web Research Functionality
The web research functionality is already implemented in the backend with:
- LeadResearchAgent that orchestrates the research process
- SearchSubAgent that performs web searches
- WebSearchTool that executes the actual searches (currently using mock data)
- Research service with proper async handling and progress tracking
- API endpoints for starting, checking status, getting results, and cancelling research

The frontend has:
- Research page with form for submitting queries
- ResearchStatus component for tracking progress
- ResearchResult component for displaying results
- Notification system for research events

## Remaining Tasks
1. Replace mock WebSearchTool with real search API integration
2. Implement GitHub API integration (Phase 1 from IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md)
3. Implement documentation generation and viewing (Phase 2 from IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md)
4. Implement LLM provider switching in UI
5. Clean up unused imports and variables
